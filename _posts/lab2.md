### Task

Write a blog post that explains a technical data science concept.

After you've received some feedback on your post, you can post it on your website, which you'll create in lab 3!

### Guidelines

#### Length: Aim for 500-800 words. Minimum is 400; maximum is 1000.

If you anticipate needing less than 400 words for a thorough explanation, choose a harder concept. If you anticipate needing more than 1000 words, choose a simpler one.

#### Audience: your classmates

Write for your classmates â€“ smart friends of yours who are new to data science but who have a professional or academic reason to understand the concept you've chosen. Make sure you say what that reason is, because your reader might not know.

#### Choosing a concept: up to you!

You can explain pretty much any technical concept you want, including ones you've already seen, or will soon see, in MDS. Here are a few technical concepts from block 1:

From 511:

* Data types in Python or R
* Loops or conditionals in Python or R
* Functions in Python or R

From 521:

* The Unix shell
* Version control with GitHub
* SSH (Secure SHell authentication)

From 551:

* Properties of statistical distributions (mean, variance, median, mode)
* The Binomial distribution
* Random variables

If you want to look ahead to concepts that will be covered in later MDS courses, feel free. Just make sure to choose something that your classmates will be able to understand *today.* (There are many such concepts in later courses, since not everything is cumulative.) Probably the most important thing is to write about something that excites you. Feel free to check with the instructor or one of the TAs if you want some advice on choosing a concept. And if you want more help brainstorming, here are a bunch of ideas:

Statistics

* What is the difference between prediction and inference?
* In statistics, what is a model?
* Model selection: the theoretical vs. the data-driven approach.
* Model validation: assumptions, challenges, and/or philosophy.
* Interpretations of probability: classical frequentist vs. Bayesian.
* The role of measurement in modelling: the assumptions we make and how they affect our interpretations and uncertainty.
* Multiple comparisons: when are they a problem and how should we deal with them?
* Power (Type II error) issues: when do we have to worry and what can we do about it?
* Missing data: is it ever really "missing completely at random"?

Data Visualization

* usability testing
* good rules of thumb
* how to make a specific type of visualization

Data science tools & workflows

* how to use a particular function and/or package
* what is tidy data?
* environment management
* package managers
* data cleaning/wrangling

### Academic integrity

Write your blog post in your own words, and give credit where credit is due.

#### Plagiarism

(Copied from the [program policies and regulations](https://ubc-mds.github.io/policies/))

Plagiarism, which is intellectual theft, occurs where an individual submits or presents the oral or written work of another person as his or her own and can include:

* multiple students submitting the same response
* copying from sources without citing them
* copying verbatim (word-for-word) from source and citing, but failing to make it explicit that this is a quotation (quotations should be used only rarely, if at all)

Plagiarism will not be tolerated in the MDS program and may result in a zero grade in the assignment or quiz where plagiarism is observed. Students are responsible for ensuring that any work submitted does not constitute plagiarism. Students who are in any doubt as to what constitutes plagiarism should consult their Instructor or Teaching Fellow before handing in any assignments.
